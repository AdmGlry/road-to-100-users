# Web Interface Guidelines

Review files for compliance with Web Interface Guidelines.

## How It Works

1. Read the vendored guidelines in `guidelines.md` (next to this file)
2. Read the specified files (or prompt user for files/pattern)
3. Check against all rules in the fetched guidelines
4. Output findings in the terse `file:line` format

## Guidelines Source

Use the local, reviewed copy: `guidelines.md` in this skill's directory
(vendored from vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines `command.md`, MIT, see SOURCE.md).
Do not fetch rules from the network: update the copy deliberately after review.

## Usage

When a user provides a file or pattern argument:
1. Read `guidelines.md`
2. Read the specified files
3. Apply all rules from the fetched guidelines
4. Output findings using the format specified in the guidelines

If no files specified, ask the user which files to review.
